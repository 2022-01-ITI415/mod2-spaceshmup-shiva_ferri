# 05-Space-SHMUP

Description of what was changed: 
Added music to the game but downloading a free arcade sound and attaching it to an audio source component
Created a score UI that displays the current count of all the enemies or asteroids destroyed.
Added multiple new enemies
Small Asteroids: They move fast but have low health
Mega Asteroids: They move slow, have a lot of health, and are big. They break apart and spawn baby asteroids when destroyed.
Baby Asteroids: These are fast, tiny, and lower health asteroids that break from Mega Asteroids
Add Visual effects to create the different asteroid models. Asteroids make use of the particle system to create a fire effect and they also contain a rock-like texture.
